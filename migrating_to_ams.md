# Migrating from using EGI ActiveMQ Message Brokers to using EGI ARGO Messaging Service

Migration requires upgrading APEL SSM to at least version 2.4.0, installing the ARGO AMS Library, and adding new values to your configuration.

The ARGO AMS Library is available in UMD as `python-argo-ams-library`. Versions above 0.5.0 are recommended.

## Sender

The sender configuration is usually found under `/etc/apel/sender.cfg`. Follow the steps below to migrate.

1. Comment out `bdii` and `network`.
1. Uncomment `host` and set it to `msg.argo.grnet.gr`.
1. Add the following as a new section at the top of your configuration:
   ```
   [sender]
   # Either 'STOMP' for STOMP message brokers or 'AMS' for Argo Messaging Service
   protocol: AMS
   ```
1. Add the following to the `[messaging]` section of your configuration:
   ```
   # If using AMS this is the project that SSM will connect to. Ignored for STOMP.
   ams_project: accounting
   ```
1. To send to the central APEL Accounting server, change `destination` to one of the following depending on your type of accounting:
   * `gLite-APEL` for Grid Accounting
   * `eu-egi-cloud-accounting` for Cloud Accounting
   * `eu-egi-storage-accounting` for Storage Accounting

The next time `ssmsend` runs it should be using the AMS. You can check this by looking in the logs for a successful run, which should look like this:

```

```

## Receiver

1. Follow the steps 1 to 4 as per the [Sender documentation](#Sender) but editing your receiver configuration instead, usually found under `/etc/apel/receiver.cfg`, naming the section `[receiver]` rather than `[sender]`.
1. Change `destination` to be the subscription you are using to pull messages down.
1. Add your token to the `[messaging]` section of your configuration:
   ```
   token: your_token_here
   ```
